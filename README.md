I'm a new coder looking to learn Python, Rust, C/C++ and possibly Go. Working on learning these languages in time and publish a portfiolo looking to go professional in time.
The current repo in my profile is a modified chart script from Python's matlibplot that is my attempt to mimic Wolfram's Mathematica's sleek chart style. 
Visit the repo's wiki page for more details at https://github.com/zwolfe21/wolfestyle_python_matplotlib.
